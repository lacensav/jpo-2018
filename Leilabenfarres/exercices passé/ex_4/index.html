         <p class="texte"> <b>Joel Meyerowitz</b> (born March 6, 1938) is an American street, portrait and landscape photographer. <br>
            He began photographing in color in 1962 and was an early advocate of the use of color during a <br>
            time when there was significant resistance to the idea of color photography as serious art. In the early <br>
            1970s he taught photography at the Cooper Union in New York City. <br>

            His work is in the collections of the International Center of Photography, Museum of Modern Art, <br>
            and New York Public Library, all in New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago.</p>
