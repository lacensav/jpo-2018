                Christopher Francis "Frank" Ocean (born Christopher Edwin Breaux; October 28, 1987), is an American singer, songwriter, and rapper. 
                His works are noted by music critics for featuring avant-garde styles and introspective, elliptical lyrics. 
                <p class="Text">
                Ocean began his musical career as a ghostwriter in 2010. 
                The following year, he released his first mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, and subsequently secured a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. 
                His first studio album, the eclectic Channel Orange (2012). </p>
                <p class="Text1">
                After a four-year hiatus, 
                Ocean released a visual album titled Endless in 2016 to fulfill contractual obligations with Def Jam. Ocean self-released his second studio album, 
                Blonde, a day after Endless's release. 
                Blonde expanded on Ocean's experimental musical approach and ranked first on Pitchfork's list of the best albums of the 2010s decade. 
                It was his first number-one album on the US Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 
                From 2017 onwards, Ocean released sporadic singles, worked as a photographer for magazines, and launched the fashion brand Homer.</p>
